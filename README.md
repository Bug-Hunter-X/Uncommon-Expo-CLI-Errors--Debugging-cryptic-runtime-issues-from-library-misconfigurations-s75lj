# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: Debugging Cryptic Runtime Issues

This repository demonstrates a common scenario where Expo CLI doesn't provide a clear error message, instead resulting in a cryptic runtime error due to library misconfiguration. The example focuses on `react-native-maps`, but the principle applies to other libraries that require native modules or specific configurations.

## Problem

When using libraries that rely on native modules (like `react-native-maps`), setup issues often result in vague or unexpected runtime errors. The Expo CLI may not provide an explicit explanation of the root cause.

## Solution

The key is to carefully review the library's installation and configuration instructions. This often involves:

* **Correct Installation:** Make sure the library is installed correctly, often using `expo install ...`
* **Proper Linking (if required):** Some libraries need explicit linking of native modules.  Expo's documentation and the library's README should guide this process.
* **Checking Package.json:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies are listed correctly.
* **Platform-Specific Configuration:** Some libraries have variations in configuration depending on whether you are targeting iOS or Android. 
* **Debugging Techniques:** Use debugging tools such as logging or a debugger to pinpoint the exact location of the error and examine relevant variables.

By carefully following best practices and using debugging techniques you can identify and resolve these elusive Expo errors.
