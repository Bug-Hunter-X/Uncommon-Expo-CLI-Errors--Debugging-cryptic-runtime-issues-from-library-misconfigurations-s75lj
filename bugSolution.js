The solution involves ensuring proper library setup and configuration:

1. **Verify Installation:** Double-check that `react-native-maps` (or your library) is correctly installed using `expo install react-native-maps`.

2. **Check for Linking Instructions:**  Consult the library's documentation. Some map libraries require manual linking of native modules, especially when working with Expo. Follow the instructions for your platform (iOS or Android).

3. **Review the Expo Documentation:** Expo's official documentation on integrating third-party libraries is valuable. It often outlines specific requirements or limitations for libraries with native dependencies.

4. **Inspect Package.json:** Make sure the library and its necessary peer dependencies are correctly specified in your `package.json` file.

5. **Implement Debugging:** Add logging statements around the area where you suspect the error occurs to help narrow down the cause.  Debugging tools can also be used to step through the code and examine the state of the application. 

**Example (Enhanced with error handling):**

```javascript
import MapView from 'react-native-maps';

const MyMap = () => {
  return (
    <MapView style={{ flex: 1 }} onError={(error) => console.error('MapView error:', error)} />
  );
};
```

Adding an `onError` handler to your map component can give you a better clue about what might be going wrong at runtime.  If you still face problems, look to the Expo community forums or the library's issue tracker for assistance.
