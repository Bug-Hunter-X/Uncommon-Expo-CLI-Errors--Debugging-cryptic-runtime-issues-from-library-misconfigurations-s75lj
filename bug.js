This error typically occurs when you're using a library or feature within Expo that hasn't been properly configured or is incompatible with your project setup.  It can manifest in various ways, depending on the specific library and what's causing the conflict. For example, you might see messages about missing modules, incorrect import paths, or runtime errors related to native modules or platform-specific code.

**Example Scenario (using `react-native-maps`):**

Let's say you're using the `react-native-maps` library, but you haven't correctly linked the native modules.  The Expo CLI might not give you a super-specific error, but you'll get runtime errors when trying to use the map component because the underlying native code is missing or misconfigured.

```javascript
import MapView from 'react-native-maps';

const MyMap = () => {
  return (
    <MapView style={{ flex: 1 }} />
  );
};
```

This would fail if `react-native-maps` isn't set up correctly, even if the import and basic component structure look fine.
